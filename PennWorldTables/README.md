# penn-world-tables

Python module for generating the Penn World Tables data set. Currenty functionality:

* `pwt.py`: contains functions for downloading the PWT data set from the web and coercing the native STATA .dta files into Pandas Panel objects for further analysis.

## TODO:

1. Write Python scripts for building the PWT data from scatch. Functionality should mimic the STATA DO files provided by PWT.
